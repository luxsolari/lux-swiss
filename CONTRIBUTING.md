# Contributing

Contributions welcome! Here's how:

## Design changes
The design language lives in `skills/lux-swiss/`. Keep the two governing
rules intact — **duotone strict** (two colors + one accent, used more freely for
action/Structural-Block/brand-moment/hover-signal jobs, but never a second hue) and
**Swiss-minimalist** (visible borders, no shadows). Changes that add a color or a
shadow contradict the system and won't be accepted; express new states through
weight, size, spacing, and contrast instead. The segment stripe (§ SKILL.md
Philosophy section) is reusable at any length, not a fixed one-off — keep it
two equal ink/Blood-Red segments regardless of length. The Accent button
reuses the Destructive button's exact visual mechanism under a different
semantic name — don't invent a second visual treatment for it. List/table
markers and borders stay ink/muted-foreground only; images default to
grayscale/duotone, with full color reserved for the one named exception
(§ SKILL.md "Images") where the photograph itself is the content.

- Palette / token changes: update both `SKILL.md`'s tables and `assets/theme.css`
  so they never drift apart.
- New component patterns: add them to `references/components.md`, and only surface
  the most common ones in `SKILL.md` to keep it lean.
